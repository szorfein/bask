# kernel args

# Enable slub/slab allocator free poisoning (requires CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y above).
slub_debug=P

# Enable buddy allocator free poisoning (requires CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING=y above).
page_poison=1

# Disable slab merging (makes many heap overflow attacks more difficult).
slab_nomerge

# Always enable Kernel Page Table Isolation, even if the CPU claims it is safe from Meltdown.
pti=on

# Remove vsyscall entirely to avoid it being a fixed-position ROP target of any kind.
# (Same as CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NONE=y above.)
vsyscall=none

# This force-enables KPTI even on CPUs claiming to be safe from spectre v2
spectre_v2=on

# Same reasoning as above but for the Spectre v4 vulnerability. Note that this mitigation requires updated microcode for Intel processors.
spec_store_bypass_disable=seccomp

# Even if we correctly enable the IOMMU in the kernel configuration, the kernel can still decide for various reasons to not initialize it at boot.
iommu=force
